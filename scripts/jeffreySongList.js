    lyric: `Once I was seven years old, my mama told me
            "Go make yourself some friends or you'll be lonely"
            Once I was seven years old

            It was a big big world, but we thought we were bigger
            Pushing each other to the limits, we were learning quicker
            By eleven smoking herb and drinking burning liquor
            Never rich so we were out to make that steady figure

            Once I was eleven years old, my daddy told me
            "Go get yourself a wife or you'll be lonely"
            Once I was eleven years old

            I always had that dream, like my daddy before me
            So I started writing songs, I started writing stories
            Something about that glory just always seemed to bore me
            'Cause only those I really love will ever really know me

            Once I was twenty years old, my story got told
            Before the morning sun, when life was lonely
            Once I was twenty years old

            (Lukas Graham!)

            I only see my goals, I don't believe in failure
            'Cause I know the smallest voices, they can make it major
            I got my boys with me, at least those in favor
            And if we don't meet before I leave, I hope I'll see you later

            Once I was twenty years old, my story got told
            I was writing 'bout everything I saw before me
            Once I was twenty years old

            Soon we'll be thirty years old, our songs have been sold
            We've traveled around the world and we're still roaming
            Soon we'll be thirty years old

            I'm still learning about life
            My woman brought children for me
            So I can sing them all my songs
            And I can tell them stories
            Most of my boys are with me
            Some are still out seeking glory
            And some I had to leave behind
            My brother, I'm still sorry

            Soon I'll be sixty years old, my daddy got sixty-one
            Remember life, and then your life becomes a better one
            I made a man so happy when I wrote a letter once
            I hope my children come and visit once or twice a month

            Soon I'll be sixty years old, will I think the world is cold
            Or will I have a lot of children who can warm me?
            Soon I'll be sixty years old

            Soon I'll be sixty years old, will I think the world is cold
            Or will I have a lot of children who can warm me?
            Soon I'll be sixty years old

            Once I was seven years old, my mama told me
            "Go make yourself some friends or you'll be lonely"
            Once I was seven years old

            Is this just fantasy?
            Caught in a landslide,
            No escape from reality.

            Open your eyes,
            Look up to the skies and see,
            I'm just a poor boy, I need no sympathy,
            Because I'm easy come, easy go,
            Little high, little low,
            Any way the wind blows doesn't really matter to me, to me.

            Mama, just killed a man,
            Put a gun against his head,
            Pulled my trigger, now he's dead.
            Mama, life had just begun,
            But now I've gone and thrown it all away.

            Mama, ooh,
            Didn't mean to make you cry,
            If I'm not back again this time tomorrow,
            Carry on, carry on as if nothing really matters.

            Too late, my time has come,
            Sends shivers down my spine,
            Body's aching all the time.
            Goodbye, everybody, I've got to go,
            Gotta leave you all behind and face the truth.

            Mama, ooh (any way the wind blows),
            I don't wanna die,
            I sometimes wish I'd never been born at all.

            I see a little silhouetto of a man,
            Scaramouche, Scaramouche, will you do the Fandango?
            Thunderbolt and lightning,
            Very, very frightening me.
            (Galileo) Galileo.
            (Galileo) Galileo,
            Galileo Figaro
            Magnifico-o-o-o-o.

            I'm just a poor boy, nobody loves me.
            He's just a poor boy from a poor family,
            Spare him his life from this monstrosity.

            Easy come, easy go, will you let me go?
            Bismillah! No, we will not let you go. (Let him go!)
            Bismillah! We will not let you go. (Let him go!)
            Bismillah! We will not let you go. (Let me go!)
            Will not let you go. (Let me go!)
            Never let you go (Never, never, never, never let me go)
            Oh oh oh oh
            No, no, no, no, no, no, no
            Oh, mama mia, mama mia (Mama mia, let me go.)
            Beelzebub has a devil put aside for me, for me, for me.

            So you think you can stone me and spit in my eye?
            So you think you can love me and leave me to die?
            Oh, baby, can't do this to me, baby,
            Just gotta get out, just gotta get right outta here.

            (Ooooh, ooh yeah, ooh yeah)

            Nothing really matters,
            Anyone can see,
            Nothing really matters,
            Nothing really matters to me.

            Swing my heart across the line
            In my face is flashing signs
            Seek it out and ye shall find

            Old but I'm not that old
            Young but I'm not that bold

            Been chasing dreams, but I never slept
            I got a new attitude and a lease on life
            And some peace of mind
            Seek and I find I can sleep when I die
            Wanna piece of the pie, grab the keys to the ride
            And shit I'm straight
            I'm on my wave, I'm on my wave
            Get out my wake, I'm running late, what can I say?
            I heard you die twice, once when they bury you in the grave
            And the second time is the last time that somebody mentions your name
            So when I leave here on this earth, did I take more than I gave?
            Did I look out for the people or did I do it all for fame?
            Legend it's exodus searching for euphoria
            Trudging through the mud to find the present, no ignoring us
            Got 20,000 deep off in the street like we some warriors
            My mama told me never bow your head, woo!

            I feel glorious, glorious
            Got a chance to start again
            I was born for this, born for this
            It's who I am, how could I forget?
            I made it through the darkest part of the night
            And now I'll see the sunrise
            Now I feel glorious, glorious
            I feel glorious, glorious

            I'm feeling glorious
            The crib looking Victorian (oh yes it is)
            You know that we been going in
            Since we hopped out that DeLorean (DeLorean, yeah we win)
            En garde, things are just things
            They don't make you who you are
            Can't pack up a U-Haul and take it with you when you're gone
            We posted on the porch, my family's glasses to the stars
            My grandma smiling down on me like woo, that boy got bars
            Okay, okay, yes I do
            I said amen and hallelujah, let me testify too
            Another morning, a morning, don't let self get in my way
            I got my breath, I got my faith and I remember why I came

            I feel glorious, glorious

            Now I feel glorious, glorious
            I feel glorious, glorious

            We gon' be alright, put that on my life
            When I open my eyes, hope I see you shine
            We're planting a flag they don't understand

            Reaching a fever pitch, it's bringing me out the dark
            Finally I can see you crystal clear
            Go 'head and sell me out and I'll lay your ship bare
            See how I leave with every piece of you
            Don't underestimate the things that I will do

            There's a fire starting in my heart
            Reaching a fever pitch
            And it's bringing me out the dark

            The scars of your love remind me of us
            They keep me thinking that we almost had it all
            The scars of your love, they leave me breathless
            I can't help feeling
            We could have had it all
            (You're gonna wish you never had met me)
            Rolling in the deep
            (Tears are gonna fall, rolling in the deep)
            You had my heart inside of your hand
            (You're gonna wish you never had met me)
            And you played it, to the beat
            (Tears are gonna fall, rolling in the deep)

            Baby, I have no story to be told
            But I've heard one on you
            And I'm gonna make your head burn
            Think of me in the depths of your despair
            Make a home down there
            As mine sure won't be shared

            (You're gonna wish you never had met me)
            The scars of your love remind me of us
            (Tears are gonna fall, rolling in the deep)
            They keep me thinking that we almost had it all
            (You're gonna wish you never had met me)
            The scars of your love, they leave me breathless
            (Tears are gonna fall, rolling in the deep)
            I can't help feeling
            We could have had it all

            Rolling in the deep
            You had my heart inside of your hand
            But you played it, with a beating

            Throw your soul through every open door (woah)
            Count your blessings to find what you look for (woah)
            Turn my sorrow into treasured gold (woah)
            You'll pay me back in kind and reap just what you sow (woah)
            (You're gonna wish you never had met me)
            We could have had it all
            (Tears are gonna fall, rolling in the deep)
            We could have had it all
            (You're gonna wish you never had met me)
            It all, it all, it all
            (Tears are gonna fall, rolling in the deep)

            We could have had it all
            (You're gonna wish you never had met me)
            Rolling in the deep

            But you played it

    lyric: `Lately I've been hard to reach, I've been too long on my own
            Everybody has a private world where they can be alone
            Are you calling me? Are you trying to get through?
            Are you reaching out for me, like I'm reaching out for you?

            I'm just so fuckin' depressed, I just can't seem to get out this slump
            If I could just get over this hump
            But I need something to pull me out this dump,
            I took my bruises, took my lumps
            Fell down and I got right back up
            But I need that spark to get psyched back up
            In order for me to pick the mic back up
            I don't know how or why or when I ended up in this position I'm in
            I'm starting to feel distant again
            So I decided just to pick this pen
            Up and try to make an attempt to vent
            But I just can't admit
            Or come to grips with the fact that I may be done with rap
            I need a new outlet, and I know some shit's so hard to swallow
            But I just can't sit back and wallow
            In my own sorrow
            But I know one fact I'll be one tough act to follow
            One tough act to follow
            I'll be one tough act to follow
            Here today, gone tomorrow
            But you'd have to walk a thousand miles

            In my shoes, just to see
            What it's like, to be me
            I'll be you, let's trade shoes
            Just to see what it'd be like to
            Feel your pain, you feel mine
            Go inside each other's minds
            Just to see what we find
            Look at shit through each other's eyes
            But don't let 'em say you ain't beautiful, oh
            They can all get fucked.
            Just stay true to you
            So don't let 'em say you ain't beautiful
            Oh, they can all get fucked.
            Just stay true to you, yeah, so...

            I think I'm starting to lose my sense of humor
            Everything is so tense and gloom
            I almost feel like I gotta check the temperature in the room
            Just as soon as I walk in
            It's like all eyes on me
            So I try to avoid any eye contact
            'Cause if I do that then it opens the door for conversation
            Like I want that... I'm not looking for extra attention
            I just want to be just like you
            Blend in with the rest of the room
            Maybe just point me to the closest restroom
            I don't need no fucking man servant
            Trying to follow me around and wipe my ass
            Laugh at every single joke I crack
            And half of them ain't even funny like
            "Ha!, Marshall you're so funny man, you should be a comedian, God damn"
            Unfortunately I am, but I just hide behind the tears of a clown
            So why don't you all sit down?
            Listen to the tale I'm about to tell
            Hell, we don't gotta trade our shoes
            And you ain't gotta walk no thousand miles

            In my shoes, just to see
            What it's like, to be me
            I'll be you, let's trade shoes
            Just to see what it'd be like to
            Feel your pain, you feel mine
            Go inside each other's minds
            Just to see what we find
            Look at shit through each other's eyes
            But don't let 'em say you ain't beautiful
            Oh they can all get fucked.
            Just stay true to you so
            Don't let 'em say you ain't beautiful
            Oh they can all get fucked.
            Just stay true to you so

            Nobody asked for life to deal us
            With these bullshit hands we're dealt
            We gotta take these cards ourselves
            And flip them, don't expect no help
            Now I could have either just
            Sat on my ass and pissed and moaned
            Or take this situation in which I'm placed in
            And get up and get my own
            I was never the type of kid
            To wait by the door and pack his bags
            Who sat on the porch and hoped and prayed
            For a dad to show up who never did
            I just wanted to fit in
            In every single place
            Every school I went
            I dreamed of being that cool kid
            Even if it meant acting stupid

            Aunt Edna always told me "Keep makin' that face it'll get stuck like that"
            Meanwhile I'm just standin' there
            Holdin' my tongue tryna talk like this
            'Til I stuck my tongue on that frozen stop sign pole at 8 years old
            I learned my lesson then cause I wasn't tryna impress my friends no more
            But I already told you my whole life story
            Not just based on my description
            'Cause where you see it from where you're sitting
            It's probably 110% different
            I guess we would have to walk a mile
            In each other's shoes, at least
            What size you wear? I wear tens
            Let's see if you can fit your feet

            In my shoes, just to see
            What it's like, to be me
            I'll be you, let's trade shoes
            Just to see what it'd be like to
            Feel your pain, you feel mine
            Go inside each other's minds
            Just to see what we find
            Look at shit through each other's eyes
            But don't let 'em say you ain't beautiful, oh
            They can all get fucked.
            Just stay true to you
            So don't let 'em say you ain't beautiful
            Oh, they can all get fucked.
            Just stay true to you, yeah, so...

            Lately I've been hard to reach, I've been too long on my own
            Everybody has a private world where they can be alone...
            So are you calling me, are you trying to get through, oh?
            Are you reaching out for me, like I'm reaching out for you?
            So oh oh

            Yeah... To my babies. Stay strong.
            Daddy will be home soon
            And to the rest of the world, God gave you them shoes
            To fit you, so put 'em on and wear 'em
            Be yourself, man, be proud of who you are
            Even if it sounds corny,
            Don't ever let no one tell you, you ain't beautiful
            So...`

            Big blue eyes, pointy nose, chasing mice, and digging holes
            Tiny paws, up the hill, suddenly you're standing still

            Your fur is red, so beautiful, like an angel in disguise
            But if you meet a friendly horse, will you communicate by mo-o-o-o-orse, mo-o-o-o-orse, mo-o-o-o-orse?

            Seas would rise when I gave the word
            Now in the morning I sleep alone
            Sweep the streets I used to own

            I used to roll the dice
            Feel the fear in my enemy's eyes
            Listened as the crowd would sing,
            "Now the old king is dead! Long live the king!"
            One minute I held the key
            Next the walls were closed on me
            And I discovered that my castles stand
            Upon pillars of salt and pillars of sand

            I hear Jerusalem bells a-ringing
            Roman cavalry choirs are singing
            Be my mirror, my sword and shield
            My missionaries in a foreign field
            For some reason I can't explain
            Once you'd gone there was never
            Never an honest word
            And that was when I ruled the world

            It was a wicked and wild wind
            Blew down the doors to let me in
            Shattered windows and the sound of drums
            People couldn't believe what I'd become
            Revolutionaries wait
            For my head on a silver plate
            Just a puppet on a lonely string
            Oh who would ever want to be king?

            I hear Jerusalem bells a-ringing
            Roman cavalry choirs are singing

              A girl with kaleidoscope eyes.
              Cellophane flowers of yellow and green
              Towering over your head.
              Look for the girl with the sun in her eyes

              Lucy in the sky with diamonds, ah, ah
              Follow her down to a bridge by the fountain
              Where rocking horse people eat marshmallow pies.
              Everyone smiles as you drift past the flowers
              That grow so incredibly high.
              Newspaper taxis appear on the shore
              Waiting to take you away
              Climb in the back with your head in the clouds 
              And you're gone.
              Picture yourself on a train in a station
              With plasticine porters with looking glass ties,
              Suddenly someone is there at the turnstile,
              The girl with kaleidoscope eyes.`

            Stepped to the mic and sang

            Just a little after nine
            In the middle of that riot
            Couldn't get you off my mind
            So, I'm at your house this morning

              I want to guard your dreams and visions
              Just wrap your legs 'round these velvet rims
              And strap your hands 'cross my engines
              Together we could break this trap
              We'll run till we drop, baby we'll never go back

              'Cause baby I'm just a scared and lonely rider

              I want to know if love is wild
              Babe I want to know if love is real
              Oh, can you show me
              Beyond the Palace hemi-powered drones scream down the boulevard
              Girls comb their hair in rearview mirrors
              And the boys try to look so hard
              The amusement park rises bold and stark
              Kids are huddled on the beach in a mist

              In an everlasting kiss
              One, two, three, four
              The highway's jammed with broken heroes on a last chance power drive
              Everybody's out on the run tonight
              But there's no place left to hide
              Together Wendy we can live with the sadness
              I'll love you with all the madness in my soul
              H-Oh, Someday girl I don't know when
              We're gonna get to that place
              Where we really wanna go
              And we'll walk in the sun

              Warm smell of colitas, rising up through the air
              Up ahead in the distance, I saw a shimmering light
              My head grew heavy and my sight grew dim
              I had to stop for the night.
              There she stood in the doorway;
              I heard the mission bell
              And I was thinking to myself
              'This could be heaven or this could be Hell'
              Then she lit up a candle and she showed me the way
              There were voices down the corridor,
              I thought I heard them say
              Welcome to the Hotel California
              Such a lovely place (such a lovely place)
              Such a lovely face.
              Plenty of room at the Hotel California
              Any time of year (any time of year) you can find it here
              Her mind is Tiffany-twisted, she got the Mercedes bends
              She got a lot of pretty, pretty boys, that she calls friends
              How they dance in the courtyard, sweet summer sweat
              Some dance to remember, some dance to forget
              So I called up the Captain,
              'Please bring me my wine'
              He said, 'we haven't had that spirit here since nineteen sixty-nine'
              And still those voices are calling from far away,
              Wake you up in the middle of the night
              Just to hear them say"
              Welcome to the Hotel California
              Such a lovely place (such a lovely place)
              Such a lovely face.
              They livin' it up at the Hotel California
              What a nice surprise (what a nice surprise), bring your alibis
              Mirrors on the ceiling,
              The pink champagne on ice
              And she said, 'we are all just prisoners here, of our own device'
              And in the master's chambers,
              They gathered for the feast
              They stab it with their steely knives,
              But they just can't kill the beast
              Last thing I remember, I was
              Running for the door
              I had to find the passage back to the place I was before
              'Relax' said the night man,
              'We are programmed to receive.
              You can check out any time you like,
              But you can never leave!'`

            You're bundled up now, wait till you get older
            But the meteor men beg to differ
            Judging by the hole in the satellite picture
            The ice we skate is getting pretty thin
            The water's getting warm so you might as well swim
            My world's on fire, how about yours?
            That's the way I like it and I never get bored
            Hey now, you're an all-star, get your game on, go play

            Only shooting stars
            Somebody once asked could I spare some change for gas?
            I need to get myself away from this place
            I said yep what a concept
            I could use a little fuel myself
            And we could all use a little change

            Don't stop, get it, get it

            Steady, watch me navigate, ha-ha-ha-ha-ha!

            Way up high
            And the dreams that you dream of
            Once in a lullaby
            Somewhere over the rainbow
            Bluebirds fly
            And the dreams that you dream of
            Dreams really do come true
            Someday, I wish upon a star
            Wake up where the clouds are far behind me
            Where trouble melts like lemon drops
            High above the chimney top
            That's where you'll find me
            Somewhere over the rainbow
            Bluebirds fly
            And the dreams that you dare to
            Oh why, oh why can't I?
            Well, I see trees of green and red roses too
            I'll watch them bloom for me and you
            And I think to myself
            What a wonderful world
            Well, I see skies of blue and I see clouds of white
            And the brightness of day
            I like the dark
            And I think to myself what a wonderful world
            The colors of the rainbow so pretty in the sky
            And also on the faces of people passing by
            I see friends shaking hands saying
            How do you do?
            They're really saying I, I love you
            I hear babies cry and I watch them grow
            They'll learn much more then we'll know
            And I think to myself what a wonderful world
            World
            Someday I wish upon a star
            Wake up where the clouds are far behind me
            Where trouble melts like lemon drops
            High above the chimney top

            Mama, mama, mama, tell us what the hell is goin' on
            Can't we all just get along?
            Father, father, father help us
            Send some guidance from above
            'Cause people got me, got me
            Questioning
            (Where's the love)
            Yo what's going on with the world, momma
            (Where's the love)
            Yo people living like they ain't got no mommas
            (Where's the love)
            I think they all distracted by the drama and
            Attracted to the trauma, mamma
            (Where's the love)
            I think they don't understand the concept or
            The meaning of karma
            (Where's the love)
            Overseas, yeah they trying to stop terrorism
            (Where's the love)
            Over here on the streets the police shoot
            The people put the bullets in 'em
            (Where's the love)
            But if you only got love for your own race
            (Where's the love)
            Then you're gonna leave space for others to discriminate
            (Where's the love)
            And to discriminate only generates hate
            And when you hate then you're bound to get irate
            Madness is what you demonstrate
            And that's exactly how hate works and operates
            Man, we gotta set it straight
            Take control of your mind and just meditate
            And let your soul just gravitate
            To the love, so the whole world celebrate it
            People killin' people dyin'

            (Where's the love)
            It just ain't the same, always in change
            (Where's the love)
            New days are strange, is the world insane?
            (Where's the love)
            Nation droppin' bombs killing our little ones
            (Where's the love)
            Ongoing suffering as the youth die young
            (Where's the love)
            Where's the love when a child gets murdered
            Or a cop gets knocked down
            Black lives not now
            Everybody matter to me
            All races, y'all don't like what I'm sayin'? Haterade, tall cases
            Everybody hate somebody
            Guess we all racist
            Black Eyed Peas do a song about love and y'all hate this
            All these protests with different colored faces
            We was all born with a heart
            Why we gotta chase it?
            And every time I look around
            Every time I look up, every time I look down
            No one's on a common ground
            (Where's the love)
            And if you never speak truth then you never know how love sounds
            (Where's the love)
            And if you never know love then you never know God, wow
            (Where's the love)
            Where's the love y'all? I don't, I don't know
            Where's the truth y'all? I don't know
            People killin' people dyin'

            Love is the key
            (Where's the love)
            Love is the answer
            (Where's the love)
            Love is the solution
            (Where's the love)
            (Where's the love)
            They don't want us to love
            (Where's the love)
            Love is powerful
            (Where's the love)
            (Where's the love)
            My mama asked me why I never vote never vote
            'Cause police men want me dead and gone (Dead and gone)
            That election looking like a joke (Such a joke)
            And the weed man still sellin' dope
            Somebody gotta give these niggas hope (Please hope)
            All he ever wanted was a smoke (My gosh)
            Said he can't breathe with his hands in the air
            Layin' on the ground died from a choke
            (Where's the love)
            I feel the weight of the world on my shoulders
            As I'm gettin' older y'all people gets colder
            Most of us only care about money makin'
            Selfishness got us followin' the wrong direction
            Wrong information always shown by the media
            Negative images is the main criteria
            Infecting the young minds faster than bacteria
            Kids wanna act like what they see in the cinemas
            What happened to the love and the values of humanity?
            (Where's the love)
            What happened to the love and the fairness and equality?
            (Where's the love)
            Instead of spreading love we're spreading animosity
            (Where's the love)
            Lack of understanding leading us away from unity
            (Where's the love)`
