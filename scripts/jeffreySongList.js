        lyric: `Once I was seven years old, my mama told me
            "Go make yourself some friends or you'll be lonely"
            Once I was seven years old

            It was a big big world, but we thought we were bigger
            Pushing each other to the limits, we were learning quicker
            By eleven smoking herb and drinking burning liquor
            Never rich so we were out to make that steady figure

            Once I was eleven years old, my daddy told me
            "Go get yourself a wife or you'll be lonely"
            Once I was eleven years old

            I always had that dream, like my daddy before me
            So I started writing songs, I started writing stories
            Something about that glory just always seemed to bore me
            'Cause only those I really love will ever really know me

            Once I was twenty years old, my story got told
            Before the morning sun, when life was lonely
            Once I was twenty years old

            (Lukas Graham!)

            I only see my goals, I don't believe in failure
            'Cause I know the smallest voices, they can make it major
            I got my boys with me, at least those in favor
            And if we don't meet before I leave, I hope I'll see you later

            Once I was twenty years old, my story got told
            I was writing 'bout everything I saw before me
            Once I was twenty years old

            Soon we'll be thirty years old, our songs have been sold
            We've traveled around the world and we're still roaming
            Soon we'll be thirty years old

            I'm still learning about life
            My woman brought children for me
            So I can sing them all my songs
            And I can tell them stories
            Most of my boys are with me
            Some are still out seeking glory
            And some I had to leave behind
            My brother, I'm still sorry

            Soon I'll be sixty years old, my daddy got sixty-one
            Remember life, and then your life becomes a better one
            I made a man so happy when I wrote a letter once
            I hope my children come and visit once or twice a month

            Soon I'll be sixty years old, will I think the world is cold
            Or will I have a lot of children who can warm me?
            Soon I'll be sixty years old

            Soon I'll be sixty years old, will I think the world is cold
            Or will I have a lot of children who can warm me?
            Soon I'll be sixty years old

            Once I was seven years old, my mama told me
            "Go make yourself some friends or you'll be lonely"
            Once I was seven years old

            Is this just fantasy?
            Caught in a landslide,
            No escape from reality.

            Open your eyes,
            Look up to the skies and see,
            I'm just a poor boy, I need no sympathy,
            Because I'm easy come, easy go,
            Little high, little low,
            Any way the wind blows doesn't really matter to me, to me.

            Mama, just killed a man,
            Put a gun against his head,
            Pulled my trigger, now he's dead.
            Mama, life had just begun,
            But now I've gone and thrown it all away.

            Mama, ooh,
            Didn't mean to make you cry,
            If I'm not back again this time tomorrow,
            Carry on, carry on as if nothing really matters.

            Too late, my time has come,
            Sends shivers down my spine,
            Body's aching all the time.
            Goodbye, everybody, I've got to go,
            Gotta leave you all behind and face the truth.

            Mama, ooh (any way the wind blows),
            I don't wanna die,
            I sometimes wish I'd never been born at all.

            I see a little silhouetto of a man,
            Scaramouche, Scaramouche, will you do the Fandango?
            Thunderbolt and lightning,
            Very, very frightening me.
            (Galileo) Galileo.
            (Galileo) Galileo,
            Galileo Figaro
            Magnifico-o-o-o-o.

            I'm just a poor boy, nobody loves me.
            He's just a poor boy from a poor family,
            Spare him his life from this monstrosity.

            Easy come, easy go, will you let me go?
            Bismillah! No, we will not let you go. (Let him go!)
            Bismillah! We will not let you go. (Let him go!)
            Bismillah! We will not let you go. (Let me go!)
            Will not let you go. (Let me go!)
            Never let you go (Never, never, never, never let me go)
            Oh oh oh oh
            No, no, no, no, no, no, no
            Oh, mama mia, mama mia (Mama mia, let me go.)
            Beelzebub has a devil put aside for me, for me, for me.

            So you think you can stone me and spit in my eye?
            So you think you can love me and leave me to die?
            Oh, baby, can't do this to me, baby,
            Just gotta get out, just gotta get right outta here.

            (Ooooh, ooh yeah, ooh yeah)

            Nothing really matters,
            Anyone can see,
            Nothing really matters,
            Nothing really matters to me.

            Any way the wind blows.`

            Yeah, we'll be counting stars

            I see this life like a swinging vine
            Swing my heart across the line

            Another sprint, another step
            Another day, another breath
            Been chasing dreams, but I never slept
            I got a new attitude and a lease on life
            And some peace of mind
            Seek and I find I can sleep when I die
            Wanna piece of the pie, grab the keys to the ride
            And shit I'm straight
            I'm on my wave, I'm on my wave
            Get out my wake, I'm running late, what can I say?
            I heard you die twice, once when they bury you in the grave
            And the second time is the last time that somebody mentions your name
            So when I leave here on this earth, did I take more than I gave?
            Did I look out for the people or did I do it all for fame?
            Legend it's exodus searching for euphoria
            Trudging through the mud to find the present, no ignoring us
            Got 20,000 deep off in the street like we some warriors
            My mama told me never bow your head, woo!

            I feel glorious, glorious
            Got a chance to start again
            I was born for this, born for this
            It's who I am, how could I forget?
            I made it through the darkest part of the night
            And now I'll see the sunrise
            Now I feel glorious, glorious
            I feel glorious, glorious

            I'm feeling glorious
            The crib looking Victorian (oh yes it is)
            You know that we been going in
            Since we hopped out that DeLorean (DeLorean, yeah we win)
            En garde, things are just things
            They don't make you who you are
            Can't pack up a U-Haul and take it with you when you're gone
            We posted on the porch, my family's glasses to the stars
            My grandma smiling down on me like woo, that boy got bars
            Okay, okay, yes I do
            I said amen and hallelujah, let me testify too
            Another morning, a morning, don't let self get in my way
            I got my breath, I got my faith and I remember why I came

            I feel glorious, glorious
            Got a chance to start again

            Now I feel glorious, glorious
            I feel glorious, glorious

            We gon' be alright, put that on my life
            When I open my eyes, hope I see you shine
            We're planting a flag they don't understand
            The world is up for grabs

            See how I leave with every piece of you
            Don't underestimate the things that I will do

            There's a fire starting in my heart
            Reaching a fever pitch
            And it's bringing me out the dark

            The scars of your love remind me of us
            They keep me thinking that we almost had it all
            The scars of your love, they leave me breathless
            I can't help feeling
            We could have had it all
            (You're gonna wish you never had met me)
            Rolling in the deep
            (Tears are gonna fall, rolling in the deep)
            You had my heart inside of your hand
            (You're gonna wish you never had met me)
            And you played it, to the beat
            (Tears are gonna fall, rolling in the deep)

            Baby, I have no story to be told
            But I've heard one on you
            And I'm gonna make your head burn
            Think of me in the depths of your despair
            Make a home down there
            As mine sure won't be shared

            (You're gonna wish you never had met me)
            The scars of your love remind me of us
            (Tears are gonna fall, rolling in the deep)
            They keep me thinking that we almost had it all
            (You're gonna wish you never had met me)
            The scars of your love, they leave me breathless

            Rolling in the deep
            You had my heart inside of your hand
            But you played it, with a beating

            Throw your soul through every open door (woah)
            Count your blessings to find what you look for (woah)
            Turn my sorrow into treasured gold (woah)
            You'll pay me back in kind and reap just what you sow (woah)
            (You're gonna wish you never had met me)
            We could have had it all
            (Tears are gonna fall, rolling in the deep)
            We could have had it all
            (You're gonna wish you never had met me)
            It all, it all, it all
            (Tears are gonna fall, rolling in the deep)

            We could have had it all
            (You're gonna wish you never had met me)
            Rolling in the deep

            Everybody has a private world where they can be alone
            Are you calling me? Are you trying to get through?
            Are you reaching out for me, like I'm reaching out for you?

            I'm just so fuckin' depressed, I just can't seem to get out this slump
            If I could just get over this hump
            But I need something to pull me out this dump,
            I took my bruises, took my lumps
            Fell down and I got right back up
            But I need that spark to get psyched back up
            In order for me to pick the mic back up
            I don't know how or why or when I ended up in this position I'm in
            I'm starting to feel distant again
            So I decided just to pick this pen
            Up and try to make an attempt to vent
            But I just can't admit
            Or come to grips with the fact that I may be done with rap
            I need a new outlet, and I know some shit's so hard to swallow
            But I just can't sit back and wallow
            In my own sorrow
            But I know one fact I'll be one tough act to follow
            One tough act to follow
            I'll be one tough act to follow
            Here today, gone tomorrow
            But you'd have to walk a thousand miles

            In my shoes, just to see
            What it's like, to be me
            I'll be you, let's trade shoes
            Just to see what it'd be like to
            Feel your pain, you feel mine
            Go inside each other's minds
            Just to see what we find
            Look at shit through each other's eyes
            But don't let 'em say you ain't beautiful, oh
            They can all get fucked.
            Just stay true to you
            So don't let 'em say you ain't beautiful
            Oh, they can all get fucked.
            Just stay true to you, yeah, so...

            I think I'm starting to lose my sense of humor
            Everything is so tense and gloom
            I almost feel like I gotta check the temperature in the room
            Just as soon as I walk in
            It's like all eyes on me
            So I try to avoid any eye contact
            'Cause if I do that then it opens the door for conversation
            Like I want that... I'm not looking for extra attention
            I just want to be just like you
            Blend in with the rest of the room
            Maybe just point me to the closest restroom
            I don't need no fucking man servant
            Trying to follow me around and wipe my ass
            Laugh at every single joke I crack
            And half of them ain't even funny like
            "Ha!, Marshall you're so funny man, you should be a comedian, God damn"
            Unfortunately I am, but I just hide behind the tears of a clown
            So why don't you all sit down?
            Listen to the tale I'm about to tell
            Hell, we don't gotta trade our shoes
            And you ain't gotta walk no thousand miles

            In my shoes, just to see
            What it's like, to be me
            I'll be you, let's trade shoes
            Just to see what it'd be like to
            Feel your pain, you feel mine
            Go inside each other's minds
            Just to see what we find
            Look at shit through each other's eyes
            But don't let 'em say you ain't beautiful
            Oh they can all get fucked.
            Just stay true to you so
            Don't let 'em say you ain't beautiful
            Oh they can all get fucked.
            Just stay true to you so

            Nobody asked for life to deal us
            With these bullshit hands we're dealt
            We gotta take these cards ourselves
            And flip them, don't expect no help
            Now I could have either just
            Sat on my ass and pissed and moaned
            Or take this situation in which I'm placed in
            And get up and get my own
            I was never the type of kid
            To wait by the door and pack his bags
            Who sat on the porch and hoped and prayed
            For a dad to show up who never did
            I just wanted to fit in
            In every single place
            Every school I went
            I dreamed of being that cool kid
            Even if it meant acting stupid

            Aunt Edna always told me "Keep makin' that face it'll get stuck like that"
            Meanwhile I'm just standin' there
            Holdin' my tongue tryna talk like this
            'Til I stuck my tongue on that frozen stop sign pole at 8 years old
            I learned my lesson then cause I wasn't tryna impress my friends no more
            But I already told you my whole life story
            Not just based on my description
            'Cause where you see it from where you're sitting
            It's probably 110% different
            I guess we would have to walk a mile
            In each other's shoes, at least
            What size you wear? I wear tens
            Let's see if you can fit your feet

            In my shoes, just to see
            What it's like, to be me
            I'll be you, let's trade shoes
            Just to see what it'd be like to
            Feel your pain, you feel mine
            Go inside each other's minds
            Just to see what we find

            Just stay true to you, yeah, so...

            Lately I've been hard to reach, I've been too long on my own
            Everybody has a private world where they can be alone...
            So are you calling me, are you trying to get through, oh?
            Are you reaching out for me, like I'm reaching out for you?
            So oh oh

            Yeah... To my babies. Stay strong.
            Daddy will be home soon
            And to the rest of the world, God gave you them shoes
            To fit you, so put 'em on and wear 'em
            Be yourself, man, be proud of who you are
            Even if it sounds corny,
            Don't ever let no one tell you, you ain't beautiful
            So...`

            Seas would rise when I gave the word
            Now in the morning I sleep alone
            Sweep the streets I used to own

            I used to roll the dice

            Roman cavalry choirs are singing
            Be my mirror, my sword and shield

            Once you'd gone there was never
            Never an honest word

            It was a wicked and wild wind
            Blew down the doors to let me in

            People couldn't believe what I'd become
            Revolutionaries wait
            For my head on a silver plate
            Just a puppet on a lonely string
            Oh who would ever want to be king?
