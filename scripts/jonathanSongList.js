    lyrics: ` This hit, that ice cold
            Michelle Pfeiffer, that white gold
            This one for them hood girls
            Them good girls straight masterpieces
            Stylin', wilin', livin' it up in the city
            Got Chucks on with Saint Laurent
            Got kiss myself, I'm so pretty
            I'm too hot (hot damn)
            Called a police and a fireman
            I'm too hot (hot damn)
            Make a dragon wanna retire man
            I'm too hot (hot damn)
            Say my name you know who I am
            I'm too hot (hot damn)
            Am I bad 'bout that money, break it down
            Girls hit your hallelujah (whoo)
            Girls hit your hallelujah (whoo)
            Girls hit your hallelujah (whoo)
            'Cause uptown funk gon' give it to you
            'Cause uptown funk gon' give it to you
