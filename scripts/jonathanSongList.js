              With tangerine trees and marmalade skies.
              Somebody calls you, you answer quite slowly,
              A girl with kaleidoscope eyes.
              Cellophane flowers of yellow and green
              Towering over your head.
              Look for the girl with the sun in her eyes
              And she's gone.
              Lucy in the sky with diamonds
              Lucy in the sky with diamonds
              Lucy in the sky with diamonds, ah, ah
              Follow her down to a bridge by the fountain
              Where rocking horse people eat marshmallow pies.
              Everyone smiles as you drift past the flowers
              That grow so incredibly high.
              Newspaper taxis appear on the shore
              Waiting to take you away
              Climb in the back with your head in the clouds 
              And you're gone.
              Picture yourself on a train in a station
              With plasticine porters with looking glass ties,
              Suddenly someone is there at the turnstile,
              The girl with kaleidoscope eyes.`

            When I left your house this morning,
            It was a little after nine
            It was in Bobcaygeon, I saw the constellations
            Reveal themselves, one star at time
            Drove back to town this morning
            With working on my mind
            I thought of maybe quittin'
            Thought of leavin' it behind
            Went back to bed this morning
            And as I'm pullin' down the blind
            Yeah, the sky was dull and hypothetical
            And fallin' one cloud at a time
            That night in Toronto
            With its checkerboard floors
            Riding on horseback
            And keeping order restored
            'Til The Men They Couldn't Hang
            Stepped to the mic and sang
            And their voices rang with that Aryan twang
            I got to your house this morning
            Just a little after nine
            In the middle of that riot
            Couldn't get you off my mind
            So, I'm at your house this morning
            Just a little after nine
            'Cause, it was in Bobcaygeon

              Chrome wheeled, fuel injected, and steppin' out over the line
              H-Oh, Baby this town rips the bones from your back
              It's a death trap, it's a suicide rap
              We gotta get out while we're young

              Yes, girl we were
              Wendy let me in I wanna be your friend
              I want to guard your dreams and visions
              Just wrap your legs 'round these velvet rims
              And strap your hands 'cross my engines
              Together we could break this trap
              We'll run till we drop, baby we'll never go back
              H-Oh, Will you walk with me out on the wire
              'Cause baby I'm just a scared and lonely rider
              But I gotta know how it feels
              I want to know if love is wild
              Babe I want to know if love is real
              Oh, can you show me
              Beyond the Palace hemi-powered drones scream down the boulevard
              Girls comb their hair in rearview mirrors
              And the boys try to look so hard
              The amusement park rises bold and stark
              Kids are huddled on the beach in a mist
              I wanna die with you Wendy on the street tonight
              In an everlasting kiss
              One, two, three, four
              The highway's jammed with broken heroes on a last chance power drive
              Everybody's out on the run tonight
              But there's no place left to hide
              Together Wendy we can live with the sadness
              I'll love you with all the madness in my soul
              H-Oh, Someday girl I don't know when
              We're gonna get to that place
              Where we really wanna go
              And we'll walk in the sun
              But till then tramps like us
              Baby we were born to run
              Oh honey, tramps like us
              Baby we were born to run
              Come on with me, tramps like us

              Now you're in New York
              These streets will make you feel brand new

              Put your lighters in the air everybody say yeah, yeah,
              Yea, yea

    lyric: `  I wanna hold 'em like they do in Texas plays
              Fold 'em, let 'em, hit me, raise it baby stay with me (I love it)
              Love Game intuition play the cards with spades to start
              And after he's been hooked I'll play the one that's on his heart
              Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh-oh-e-oh-oh-oh
              I'll get him hot, show him what I've got
              Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh-oh-e-oh-oh-oh,
              I'll get him hot, show him what I've got
              Can't read my
              Can't read my
              No he can't read my poker face
              (She's got me like nobody)

              A little gambling is fun when you're with me (I love it)
              Russian Roulette is not the same without a gun
              And baby when it's love, if its not rough it isn't fun, fun
              Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh-oh-e-oh-oh-oh
