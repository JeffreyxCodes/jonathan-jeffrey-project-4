    lyric: ` Picture yourself in a boat on a river
              With tangerine trees and marmalade skies.
              Somebody calls you, you answer quite slowly,
              A girl with kaleidoscope eyes.
              Cellophane flowers of yellow and green
              Towering over your head.
              Look for the girl with the sun in her eyes
              And she's gone.
              Lucy in the sky with diamonds
              Lucy in the sky with diamonds
              Lucy in the sky with diamonds, ah, ah
              Follow her down to a bridge by the fountain
              Where rocking horse people eat marshmallow pies.
              Everyone smiles as you drift past the flowers
              That grow so incredibly high.
              Newspaper taxis appear on the shore
              Waiting to take you away
              Climb in the back with your head in the clouds 
              And you're gone.
              Picture yourself on a train in a station
              With plasticine porters with looking glass ties,
              Suddenly someone is there at the turnstile,
              The girl with kaleidoscope eyes.`
